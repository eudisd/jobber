A craigslist jobs viewer extension for Google Chrome.  It is my first extension.

I made it very simple.  It uses a synchronous XHR to refresh the latest craigslist
jobs listing for software and engineering jobs.  

I've found myself constantly checking these two particular pages quite a bit, as has been my
primary way of finding internships.  So far, two of my internships have resulted from
browsing these particular pages.  Hope it is as useful to you, as it has been to 
me.


Directions:
	I am not hosting this extension anyware as a .crx file.  To install the extension, you have two 
	options. 
		1. Type: chrome://extensions and "Developer Mode," then upload unpackaged
		   extension.
		 
		2. After clicking "Develpoer Mode", click on "Pack Extension" and pack it yourself.
