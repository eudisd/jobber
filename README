A craigslist jobs viewer extension for Google Chrome.  It is my first extension.

I made is very simple.  It uses a synchronous XHR to refresh the latest craigslist
jobs listing for software and engineering jobs.  

I found myself constantly checking these two particular pages quite often, as it's my
primary way of finding internships.  So far, two of my internships have resulted from
my browsing in these particular pages.  Hope it is as useful to you, as it has been to 
me.
