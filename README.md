# A craigslist jobs viewer extension for Google Chrome.

I made it very simple.  It uses a synchronous XHR to refresh the latest craigslist
jobs listing for software and engineering jobs.  

I've found myself constantly checking these two particular pages quite a bit, as has been my
primary way of finding internships.  So far, two of my internships have resulted from
browsing these particular pages.  Hope it is as useful to you, as it has been to 
me.


### Directions:
I am not hosting this extension anyware as a .crx file.  To install the extension, you have two 
options:
1. Type chrome://extensions on your chrome URI input and click on **Developer Mode**.  Then upload unpackaged extension.
2. After clicking _Develpoer Mode_, click on _Pack Extension_ and pack it yourself.
